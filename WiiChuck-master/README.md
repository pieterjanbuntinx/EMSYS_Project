# Repository Structure 
This repository is forked from a curated set of old Arduino Libraries. I kept the old commits and the fork linking to keep attribution to the work done before I picked up the torch. In my mind we all see farther by standing on the shoulders of giants, so it is only proper to give credit where credit is due.
